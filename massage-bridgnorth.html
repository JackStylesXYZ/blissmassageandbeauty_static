      <h2>Deep Tissue Massage</h2>
      
      <p>Deep tissue massage works on the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue to release chronic tension, knots and areas of discomfort. It uses slower, more focused pressure to reach the root of tension and support long-term relief.</p>
      
      <p>This treatment is particularly helpful for those who experience persistent tightness, postural strain or discomfort from physical activity. While firm, the pressure is always guided by your feedback and comfort level.</p>
